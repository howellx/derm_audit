Notes:
The firstworking code seems to be outputting skin features
	-No longer outputting gray or random pixels
	-Seems to alternate between benign and malignant features for sampling, not sure

Future modifications:
Add two sample generations in test
	-x_gen_melanoma: condition with 1s
	-x_gen_benign: condition with 0s

Change the sample thing to not only create new image, but condition those samples

Currently:

        x_i = torch.randn(n_sample, *size).to(device)
        
        # Create binary class indices
        c_i = torch.arange(0, 2).to(device)  # [0, 1] for binary classification
        c_i = c_i.repeat(int(n_sample/c_i.shape[0]))

Change to: 

	if x_init is not None:
		x_i = x_init.clone()
	    else:
		x_i = torch.randn(n_sample, *size).to(device)
	    
	    # Use provided condition if given
	    if condition is not None:
		c_i = condition
	    else:
		c_i = torch.arange(0, 2).to(device)
		c_i = c_i.repeat(int(n_sample/c_i.shape[0]))

	This is because this one will not randomly choose between 1 and 0 when sampling, it will 
	let us put both conditioned outputs side by side
